# stetson-modular-guide
A reference for using the modular synths available to DIGA 365-366 students at [Stetson University](https://www.stetson.edu/).

## Goals

We want to record the following information for every module in our Eurorack setup:

- link to the manufacturer page
- link to the manual
- identify the course meta-category (synthesis+sampling/processing/control)
- guidance about best default/starting settings, text, photo, and/or explanation
